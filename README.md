# Global-Terrorism-Analysis
## Overview
This project aims to analyze global terrorism data using SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization. The dataset contains information on various terrorist incidents worldwide.

## Project Structure
SQL Database: Data loading, cleaning, and querying.

Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:

Event ID

Date (Year, Month, Day)

Location (Country, Region, City)

Attack details (Type, Target, Weapon)

Casualties (Killed, Wounded)

Additional details (Motive, Summary)

## SQL Implementation

Database Creation: terrorism_analysis

Table Creation: terrorism_data

Data Loading: Using COPY command to load CSV data.

### Data Cleaning:

Checking for missing values

Removing incomplete records

### Standardizing text fields

### Data Queries:

Total number of attacks

Total casualties

Yearly and monthly distribution

Common attack types and target types

Geographic and temporal analysis

## Power BI Visualization

Using Power BI, we created visualizations to gain insights, including:

1.Number of attacks over time.

2.Geographic distribution of attacks

3.Common attack types and target types

4.Casualties by region and year

## Insights
Most attacks occurred in specific regions.
High casualty rates in certain attack types.
Month-to-month variations in attack frequency.
Predominant use of specific weapon types.

 ## Conclusion
This project provides insights into global terrorism patterns and trends. It showcases the use of SQL for data management and Power BI for powerful visual storytelling.
